# FInal Year Project
This is a personal wardrobe organiser/outfit generator app. The app ueses an ML model (MobileNetV2) trained on a modified version of the DeepFashion database to categorize clothing images. The codelab used to train the model can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cGvpHMu-AElc3jjf-xaTiZzj29QX2weE#scrollTo=qNokDnTiVV3g

The app is still a work in progress.
